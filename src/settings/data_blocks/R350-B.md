# R350-B

## Variables
- U ...  First horizontal wind component (x)
- V ...  Second horizontal wind component (y)
- W ...  Vertical wind component (z)
- T_SONIC ... Sonic temperature
- SA_DIAG_TYPE ... Status address 
  - defines which particular aspect of the anemometer the following data field (SA_DIAG_VAL) refers to
    - Address    Function
    - 00         Error codes
    - 01         Anemometer configuration
    - 02         Data output configuration 1
    - 03         Data output configuration 2
    - 04         Error code history
    - 05         Transducer gain levels
    - 06         Anemometer Type
- SA_DIAG_VAL ... Status data
  - Called ```StaD``` (Status Data) in manual
  - SA_DIAG_VAL is rather complex and can tak on a lot of meanings.
  - Has to be interpreted in combination with SA_DIAG_TYPE, which gives the type
    of SA_DIAG_VAL.    
  - Saved as an integer value, e.g. ```47```.
  - The integer can be converted to binary, e.g. ```47``` becomes ```0b101111``` , whereby the
    first two characters ```0b``` mean that this is binary format.
  - From the binary, detailed information can be extracted, depending on which bits
    in the binary are set to 1 or 0.  
  - Please refer to the manual for detailed information about what the different bits mean
    when they are 1 or zero.
- INC_XY ... Inclinometer, alternatively x (odd record numbers) and y (even record numbers)

## BICO Settings
- For an explanation of the different variable property settings, please see ```_help_bico_settings.md```.

*Before BICO, the binary conversion was done in FCT FluxCalcTool:*
- Old data block in FCT: This particular format was not implemented in FCT, but data_block_sonic_r3_50 was
the previous R3-50 format used in older data.
- FCT Source code: --> https://gitlab.ethz.ch/holukas/fct-flux-calculation-tool

## Details
- Use of this format started somewhen in 2017 with an update of the sonicread script used to log eddy covariance data.

## Binary info
- B...unsigned char, integer, 1 Byte
- h...short integer, 2 Bytes
- ">"...big-endian, MSB most-significant Byte at lowest address
     Big-endian systems store the most significant byte of a word in the smallest address
