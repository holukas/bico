# R350-R1

## Variables

- U ... First horizontal wind component (x) (m s-1)
- V ... Second horizontal wind component (y) (m s-1)
- W ... Vertical wind component (z) (m s-1)
- T_SONIC ... Sonic temperature (K)
- SA_DIAG_TYPE ... Status address
    - defines which particular aspect of the anemometer the following data field (SA_DIAG_VAL) refers to
        - Address Function
        - 00 Error codes
        - 01 Anemometer configuration
        - 02 Data output configuration 1
        - 03 Data output configuration 2
        - 04 Error code history
        - 05 Transducer gain levels
        - 06 Anemometer Type
- SA_DIAG_VAL ... Status data
    - Called ```StaD``` (Status Data) in manual
    - SA_DIAG_VAL is rather complex and can tak on a lot of meanings.
    - Has to be interpreted in combination with SA_DIAG_TYPE, which gives the type
      of SA_DIAG_VAL.
    - Saved as an integer value, e.g. ```47```.
    - The integer can be converted to binary, e.g. ```47``` becomes ```0b101111``` , whereby the
      first two characters ```0b``` mean that this is binary format.
    - From the binary, detailed information can be extracted, depending on which bits
      in the binary are set to 1 or 0.
    - Please refer to the manual for detailed information about what the different bits mean
      when they are 1 or zero.

## BICO Settings

- This datablock does not need conversion because it is already logged in ASCII format.

## Details

- Datablock originates from the new logging script `rECord`, which will replace the old logging script `sonicread`.
- This datablock was originally used for
  the `rECord` [test phase at the research site CH-FRU in 2023](https://www.swissfluxnet.ethz.ch/index.php/sites/site-info-ch-fru/ec-raw-binary-format/#Setup_with_rECord_data_logging_since_2023).
- More info about `sonicread` can be found in `docs/sonicread_20190503.pdf`.
