# HS50-R1

## Variables
- U ... First horizontal wind component (x) (m s-1)
- V ... Second horizontal wind component (y) (m s-1)
- W ... Vertical wind component (z) (m s-1)
- T_SONIC ... Sonic temperature (degC)
- SA_DIAG_TYPE ... Status type indicator (error, inclinometer, configuration)
  - Called ```StaA``` (Status Address) in manual
  - defines which particular aspect of the anemometer the following data field (SA_DIAG_VALUE) refers to 
    - 00 Error codes
    - 01 Anemometer configuration
    - 02 Data output configuration 1
    - 03 Data output configuration 2
    - 04 Error code history
    - 05 Transducer gain levels
    - 06 Anemometer Type
    - 07 Inclinometer X axis MSB
    - 08 Inclinometer X axis LSB
    - 09 Inclinometer Y axis MSB
    - 10 Inclinometer Y axis LSB
- SA_DIAG_VALUE ... Status value and information
  - Called ```StaD``` (Status Data) in manual
  - SA_DIAG_VALUE is rather complex and can tak on a lot of meanings.
  - Has to be interpreted in combination with SA_DIAG_TYPE, which gives the type
    of SA_DIAG_VALUE.    
  - Saved as an integer value, e.g. ```47```.
  - The integer can be converted to binary, e.g. ```47``` becomes ```0b101111``` , whereby the
    first two characters ```0b``` mean that this is binary format.
  - From the binary, detailed information can be extracted, depending on which bits
    in the binary are set to 1 or 0.  
  - Please refer to the manual for detailed information about what the different bits mean
    when they are 1 or zero.

## BICO Settings
- This datablock does not need conversion because it is already logged in ASCII format.

## Details
- Instrument: Gill HS-50
- Datablock originates from the logging script `rECord`, which replaces the old logging script `sonicread`.
- More info about `sonicread` can be found in `docs/sonicread_20190503.pdf`.
