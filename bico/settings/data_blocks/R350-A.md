# R350-A

## Variables
- U ...  First horizontal wind component (x)
- V ...  Second horizontal wind component (y)
- W ...  Vertical wind component (z)
- T_SONIC ... Sonic temperature
- INC_X ... Inclinometer x
- INC_Y ... Inclinometer y

## BICO Settings
- 'order' ... Order in the data block variable sequence
- 'bytes' ... Number of bytes in the binary data
- 'format' ... Format to convert from binary to integers, floats, etc.
- 'gain_on_signal' ... Gain that was applied to the raw data signal, to get to units *divide* by this gain
- 'offset_on_signal' ... Offset that was added to the raw data signal, to get to units *subtract* this offset
- 'apply_gain' ... Gain that is applied during conversion, e.g. to convert to different units if needed
- 'add_offset' ... Offset that is added during conversion, e.g. to convert to different units if needed
- 'units' ... Units
- 'datablock' ... Data block ID

*Before BICO, the binary conversion was done in FCT FluxCalcTool:*
- Old ID in FCT: r3-50
- Old data block in FCT: data_block_sonic_r3_50
- FCT Source code: --> https://gitlab.ethz.ch/holukas/fct-flux-calculation-tool

## Details
- none

## Binary info
- B...unsigned char, integer, 1 Byte
- h...short integer, 2 Bytes
- ">"...big-endian, MSB most-significant Byte at lowest address
     Big-endian systems store the most significant byte of a word in the smallest address
